Implementation
--------------

Changing DivaScheme to support features necessary for WOOT

Writing network code

Adjusting GUI

Adapting the WOOT algorithm



DivaScheme overview
-------------------

What is DivaScheme

What are the different modes?  Insert mode, Command mode.

What are the operations we're supporting?

Insert, Delete.  Move is currently represented as a combination of
insertion and deletion; future work to make move work at an operation
peer to the others.


Merging unstructured state-based DivaScheme with structured operation-based algorithm
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

What does WOOT require from DivaScheme?

* Persistent data structures

* Interpretation of commands expressed as operations rather than direct changes to world state


What did we have to do to maintain such structures?





etc. (we're still working on the implementation!)
