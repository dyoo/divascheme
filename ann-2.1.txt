Subject: Announcing DivaScheme: semi-structured program editing

                              DivaScheme
         ...for times when you wish your doctor would listen

         
DivaScheme is an alternative set of key bindings for DrScheme.  When
DivaScheme is on, the most important functions of DrScheme are
available through unchorded keystrokes, and the motion commands
operate on sexps by default.

To install, evaluate:

    (require (planet "install.ss" ("divascheme" "divascheme.plt")))

at the DrScheme REPL.  After restarting DrScheme, DivaScheme can then
be toggled on or off by pressing F4.  More information about DivaScheme,
including demo screencasts, can be found on its web site:
