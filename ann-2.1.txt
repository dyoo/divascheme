Subject: Announcing DivaScheme: semi-structured program editing

                              DivaScheme
         ...for times when you wish your doctor would listen


DivaScheme is an alternative set of key bindings for DrScheme.  When
DivaScheme is on, the most important functions of DrScheme are
available through unchorded keystrokes, and the motion commands
operate on sexps by default.  DivaScheme also automatically manages
whitespace and balances parentheses.
