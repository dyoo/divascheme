Bugs:

String literals with escapes \\ in them don't clean up correctly.


Cleanup kills whitespace in strings.  i.e: "hello\n world" will get
collapsed into "hello\nworld"


Editing a symbol aligned on the left column highlights across the newline on the previous line.

   - fixed

Here strings don't work.

Nested comment #| |# don't work.

Changing tabs in insert mode breaks something.
