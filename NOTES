Bugs:

String literals with escapes \\ in them don't clean up correctly.

Cleanup kills whitespace in strings.  i.e: "hello\n world" will get
collapsed into "hello\nworld"

Copy-and-paste does not use the cleanup functions at the moment.
Also cut and paste are not dedotting anymore.

   - fixed

Here strings don't work.

Nested comment #| |# don't work.

Closing a "---" that doesn't have an $expr$ holder kills an sexpr that
probably shouldn't die.

Check syntax in insert mode does not defocus as it should.  All of the
button presses should get us out of insert mode.


Major slowness on large files.


Inserting a snip in Insert mode breaks.
