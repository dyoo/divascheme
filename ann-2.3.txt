         ...for times when you wish your doctor would listen

This is a minor point release of DivaScheme for bug fixes and
performance tuning.


To install, evaluate:

    (require (planet "install.ss" ("divascheme" "divascheme.plt" 1 3)))

at the DrScheme REPL.


After restarting DrScheme, DivaScheme can then be toggled on or off by
pressing F4.  More information about DivaScheme, including a demo
screencast, can be found on its web site:

Changes
=======

Release 2.3:

Features:

* Fixed bug concerning parsing of comments.  Comments can be edited
  just like strings now.

* Fixed bug involving switching tabs while in insert mode.

* Up and down can be used in insert mode.  install.ss will try to
  automatically upgrade your keybindings appropriately.

* Tab completion behavior improved.  Also, symbols from mzscheme will
  also be considered.

* Improved lexical whitespace cleanup: fixed bug that munged strings
  spanning multiple lines.

* Lots of other bug fixes.

* General improvements in memory usage and performance.
