Subject: DivaScheme 2.3 released

                              DivaScheme
         ...for times when you wish your doctor would listen

This is a minor point release of DivaScheme for bug fixes and
performance tuning.  DivaScheme requires DrScheme >=360.


To install, evaluate:

    (require (planet "install.ss" ("divascheme" "divascheme.plt" 1 3)))

at the DrScheme REPL.


After restarting DrScheme, DivaScheme can then be toggled on or off by
pressing F4.  More information about DivaScheme, including a demo
screencast, can be found on its web site:

Changes
=======

Release 2.3:

Features and bug fixes:

* Graphical snips are supported.

* Comments can be edited without exiting DivaScheme.

* Up and down can be used in Insert Mode.  install.ss will try to
  automatically upgrade your keybindings appropriately.

* Tab autocompletion behavior has been improved.  In DrScheme v371+,
  autocompletion will consider keywords provided by the language.

* generate-stags no longer installs when DivaScheme is installed,
  since not all users have directory write permissions to plt/bin.
  Search for "generate-stags" in Help Desk for details on installing
  generate-stags.

* Improved lexical whitespace cleanup and tokenization.

* Bugfix: switching tabs while in insert mode would violate
  invariants.

* Workaround: Check Syntax is temporarily disabled during Insert Mode.

* Bugfix: joining on column 1 would potentially collapse two symbols.

* Lots of other bug fixes and general improvements in memory usage and
  performance.
