Subject: DivaScheme 2.2 released

                              DivaScheme
         ...for times when you wish your doctor would listen

This is a minor point release of DivaScheme; it includes a few bug fixes,
as well as the much requested feature of '[' for the context-sensitive
open-paren feature in DrScheme.

To install, evaluate:

    (require (planet "install.ss" ("divascheme" "divascheme.plt" 1 1)))

at the DrScheme REPL.  If you've previously installed DivaScheme, the
install.ss invocation above should automatically update your preferences
to support the new keybindings for contextual open-paren.


After restarting DrScheme, DivaScheme can then be toggled on or off by
pressing F4.  More information about DivaScheme, including a demo
screencast, can be found on its web site:
