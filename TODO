dyoo 2006/10/26: I need to put all acccumlated bugs in a real bug
tracker.  I'll list the ones that I've accumulated from others:


Jon Rafkind:

* it would be nice if shift-t would transpose the current sexp with the
next sexp, as t transposes it with the previous one
* hitting backspace when the current token is empty should go back to
the last token and edit that instead. If I type "fo bar" and realize I
meant "foo" I have to go back to command mode, move to 'fo' and edit it.
It would be easier to hit backspace 3 times, erasing 'bar' and edit 'fo'
directly.
* pressing space on whitespace and then moving breaks divascheme with
the error
DivaScheme Error: #(struct:exn:fail:contract first: expected argument of
type <non-empty list>; given #f #<continuation-mark-set>)
first: expected argument of type <non-empty list>; given #f



Matthias Felleisen:

Did you read all the articles on structured editing from the 1980s?
Also try to find some documentation on how to edit in Franz Lisp.
P.S. Why don't you make it into a PLANET tool?




Mark Haniford:

I have a different problem with DivaScheme.  Sometimes after I've
typed in a function and hit run, I'll get a "colorizer exception" and
the editor is unusable so I have to restart Dr. Scheme



Chris Warrington:

Could the [ key insert the proper '(' or '[' depending on the context
as the [ currently does now? For examples, using only the [ key, I can
produce
(cond [(zero? n) 1]
      [else 0])
With DivaScheme, I have to use { to get the '['.
CTRL+C does not seem to work on Windows.
The F5 key does not work in insert mode. I think that it should exit
insert mode and run the definitions.


David Cabana:

I want to thank you and your team for DivaScheme. It is a very nice
addition to an already outstanding product.  I have a question (of
course). I use the Dvorak keyboard layout, so the i,j,k,l keys do not
form an inverted T for me. Is there an easy way to remap these?  I
looked at the code, but I am just a novice schemer. I could not see
how to do it.



Guillaume Marceau:

sources on a public svn
add an link to the high-res movie on the web page

release via planet

space-extend is broken

I think ctrl-space should auto-complete too. Also, Eclipse
auto-completes on space+space. Aka, space on an empty token
auto-completes the previous token.

the "backspace on empty token" idea is good

- mark should disapear after edits (?)
- previous should stay available

	- should have a callback to know if the buffer was edited, thus not to recompute the syntax of the text
        - _search_ should take multiple arguments ("search define bind")
	- _enter_ should insert a newline after the cursor position, except when the cursor is at the beginning of a placeholder
 	- _close_ should have another semantics
	- _bring_, _push_ should take arguments
	- _out_, _in_, _delete_, _copy_, _cut_, _paste_ should take arguments
	- when changing tab, the focus should remember if it was in the Diva Box (if it was before, then you change of tab, then you come back, the Diva Box does not have the focus anymore)
	- when the voice recognition was good, we should not have to hit [Enter]
	- improving _again_, so that "delete define next again next cancel" works as expected
	- _forward_ and _backward_ should take an argument: "forward 5"
	- find another name for _first_ (interferes with the Scheme function)
	- "Insert After" should work and mean "Insert After This"
	- meaning of "open square open"
	- rewrite and refactor manys part of the code. index stuffs should not appear in actions.ss .
          Probably many functions in traversal.ss are doing the same thing. mred-state.ss has dead code. 
	- action can reuse DrScheme's code by wrapping the World-text in a scheme:text%
	- gray-highlighting to know with which expression we are dealing with (_close_ command)
	- magic should look for completion in the other open tabs and the repl
	- an algorithm for "symbol equal huh"
	- cleanup-whitespace breaks on multilines string, or pipe, or any atomic multinlines ---> solution: before calling cleanup-whitespace, we should ask which object in under the cursor, and if it is an atomic, then returns the end position of this atom to cleanup-whitespace
	- what to do for the cursor after a command if there is no template?
	- when hitting "f2" in insert mode, the focus should be given to the Diva Box
	- improving every error messages
	- scroll bar jumps around
	- we should be able to insert the symbol quote instead of the macro (" ' $expr$ " instead of " (quote $expr$) ")
	- cleanup-whitespace should insert missing space
	- F4 should remember which mode between voice/command it came from
	- ALT-h and ALT-l for sexp motion
	- have h and l also do insert-before and insert-after
	- make keyboard searches interactive and colored (like Emacs)
	- ALT-j instead of J
	- _holder_ on ALT-o
	- next and previous should cycle after giving a warning
	- previous/next are backward for search-backward and search-bottom
	- re-read the buffer *after* displaying
	- find a way to kill the template if not needed ; maybe with _pass_, the zeroth element
	- a command "go to line"
	- a command to center the text in the window
	- to be able to type keyword in Diva mode
	- a vertical cleanup-whitespace ?
	- ...
