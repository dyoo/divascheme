Jon Rafkind:

* it would be nice if shift-t would transpose the current sexp with the
next sexp, as t transposes it with the previous one

    - Address using keyboard macros.  Need to look at DrScheme to allow
      ESC as part of macro sequence.

* hitting backspace when the current token is empty should go back to
the last token and edit that instead. If I type "fo bar" and realize I
meant "foo" I have to go back to command mode, move to 'fo' and edit it.
It would be easier to hit backspace 3 times, erasing 'bar' and edit 'fo'
directly.

    - yes, agreed.

    

Chris Warrington:

Could the [ key insert the proper '(' or '[' depending on the context
as the [ currently does now? For examples, using only the [ key, I can
produce
(cond [(zero? n) 1]
      [else 0])
With DivaScheme, I have to use { to get the '['.

    - in the future


CTRL+C does not seem to work on Windows.

    - keep this disabled



Guillaume Marceau:

sources on readable public svn

    - write a script that updates the plt web site with latest sources.
    - maybe add mirrored svn on hashcollision.org
    
add an link to the high-res movie on the web page

    - dyoo: do this


space-extend is broken

    - still broken, needs fixing

I think ctrl-space should auto-complete too. Also, Eclipse
auto-completes on space+space. Aka, space on an empty token
auto-completes the previous token.

    - still broken, needs fixing


clicking should work in insert mode. it should exit insert then move
losing focus to go read the help desk, for example, should not leave insert mode

     - yeah, this would be good.  next release

undo is wrong around calls to transpose

     - not fixed yet


We should have a menu item to invoke STAGS
     
We should accomodate both emacs and bash style auto-completion.
     
Did you know that DrScheme has emacs-style macros? exciting! but divascheme breaks them.

- the mark should disapear after edits, pressing shift-M after each bring is annoying

- bring is broken at the moment

- previous should stay available

- _search_ should take multiple arguments ("search define bind")

- Probably many functions in traversal.ss are doing the same thing. mred-state.ss has dead code. 

- magic should look for completion in the other open tabs and the repl

- cleanup-whitespace breaks on multilines string, or pipe, or any atomic multilines 
    ---> solution: before calling cleanup-whitespace, we should ask which object in under the cursor, 
    and if it is an atomic, then returns the end position of this atom to cleanup-whitespace

- cleanup-whitespace should insert missing space
- make keyboard searches interactive and colored (like Emacs)
- previous/next are backward for search-backward and search-bottom
- a command "go to line"
- a command to center the text in the window

        
Preference box should have options for templates.


DivaScheme should be aware of editor modes and pause if we're editing in text.

Misspelling a function name when editing key bindings fails silently, it should indicate that there is a program.
