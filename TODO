- mark should disapear after edits (?)
- previous should stay available

	- should have a callback to know if the buffer was edited, thus not to recompute the syntax of the text
        - _search_ should take multiple arguments ("search define bind")
	- _enter_ should insert a newline after the cursor position, except when the cursor is at the beginning of a placeholder
 	- _close_ should have another semantics
	- _bring_, _push_ should take arguments
	- _out_, _in_, _delete_, _copy_, _cut_, _paste_ should take arguments
	- when changing tab, the focus should remember if it was in the Diva Box (if it was before, then you change of tab, then you come back, the Diva Box does not have the focus anymore)
	- when the voice recognition was good, we should not have to hit [Enter]
	- improving _again_, so that "delete define next again next cancel" works as expected
	- _forward_ and _backward_ should take an argument: "forward 5"
	- find another name for _first_ (interferes with the Scheme function)
	- "Insert After" should work and mean "Insert After This"
	- meaning of "open square open"
	- rewrite and refactor manys part of the code. index stuffs should not appear in actions.ss .
          Probably many functions in traversal.ss are doing the same thing. mred-state.ss has dead code. 
	- action can reuse DrScheme's code by wrapping the World-text in a scheme:text%
	- gray-highlighting to know with which expression we are dealing with (_close_ command)
	- magic should look for completion in the other open tabs and the repl
	- an algorithm for "symbol equal huh"
	- cleanup-whitespace breaks on multilines string, or pipe, or any atomic multinlines ---> solution: before calling cleanup-whitespace, we should ask which object in under the cursor, and if it is an atomic, then returns the end position of this atom to cleanup-whitespace
	- what to do for the cursor after a command if there is no template?
	- when hitting "f2" in insert mode, the focus should be given to the Diva Box
	- improving every error messages
	- scroll bar jumps around
	- we should be able to insert the symbol quote instead of the macro (" ' $expr$ " instead of " (quote $expr$) ")
	- cleanup-whitespace should insert missing space
	- F4 should remember which mode between voice/command it came from
	- ALT-h and ALT-l for sexp motion
	- have h and l also do insert-before and insert-after
	- make keyboard searches interactive and colored (like Emacs)
	- ALT-j instead of J
	- _holder_ on ALT-o
	- next and previous should cycle after giving a warning
	- previous/next are backward for search-backward and search-bottom
	- re-read the buffer *after* displaying
	- find a way to kill the template if not needed ; maybe with _pass_, the zeroth element
	- a command "go to line"
	- a command to center the text in the window
	- to be able to type keyword in Diva mode
	- a vertical cleanup-whitespace ?
	- ...
